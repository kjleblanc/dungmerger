# ⚔️ Merge Dungeon MVP (First 10 Minutes)

## Starting Setup
- **Grid**: 5x5 board  
- **Heroes**: Warrior + Mage (sitting on bottom row)  
- **Enemies**: Slimes + Bats (spawn in top rows)  
- **Drops**: Loot bags → food tiles  
- **Food Effects**:  
  - Meat → restores stamina  
  - Mushrooms → grant EXP  

---

## Core Actions
1. **Click Hero**  
   - Warrior spawns *Sword Strike* tile  
   - Mage spawns *Spark* tile  
   - Each click costs stamina (small bar per hero)  

2. **Merge Tiles**  
   - 3x Sword Strikes → Cleave  
   - 3x Sparks → Fireball  

3. **Drag Abilities onto Enemies**  
   - Sword Strike → kills Slime  
   - Cleave → kills Bat instantly  
   - Enemies drop loot bag tiles  

4. **Tap Loot Bags**  
   - Slime Bag → Goo, Mushroom  
   - Bat Pouch → Bat Wing, Bone  

5. **Merge Food → Feed Heroes**  
   - 3x Goo → Goo Jelly (stamina food)  
   - 3x Mushrooms → Mushroom Stew (EXP food)  
   - Feeding food either restores stamina (so they can spawn more tiles) or levels them up (better spawns)  

---

## Progression in First 10 Minutes
**Minute 1–3:**  
- Spawn basic Sword Strikes and Sparks  
- Kill a few Slimes → collect Goo, Mushrooms  
- Merge Goo → Jelly → feed Warrior → restore stamina  

**Minute 3–5:**  
- Start merging 3 Sparks → Fireball  
- Fireball clears multiple enemies at once  
- Bat enemies appear → drop Bat Wings  

**Minute 5–7:**  
- Merge Mushrooms → Stew → feed Mage → EXP gain  
- Mage levels up → sometimes spawns Fireball directly instead of Spark  
- Warrior stamina dips low → forced to feed Goo Jelly to keep him spawning  

**Minute 7–10:**  
- Enemies fill the board faster  
- Merge Bat Wings → Grilled Wings → EXP food  
- Feed Warrior → he levels → now spawns Cleave instead of Sword Strike  
- Loop starts feeling richer:  
  - Stronger hero spawns  
  - New food types for different purposes  
  - Board pressure from more frequent enemy spawns  

---

## End of 10 Minutes
Player now understands:  
- **Click heroes → spawn → merge → drag to kill**  
- **Enemies drop loot bags → food → merge → feed heroes**  
- **Food = stamina, EXP, or buffs**  
- **Heroes evolve as generators over time**  

---

## Minimal Slice Summary
- 2 heroes (Warrior, Mage)  
- 2 enemy types (Slime, Bat)  
- 2 food chains (Goo → Jelly, Mushrooms → Stew)  
- 2 ability merges (Sword Strike → Cleave, Spark → Fireball)  

Enough to clearly show the core loop and progression in the first 10 minutes.
